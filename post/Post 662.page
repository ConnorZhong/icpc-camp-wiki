# Beijing 2016 G A Triangle Puzzle

We invented a new kind of puzzle.\par
It is played on triangle towers.
The structure of the triangle towers is as shown above. The $i^{th}$ layer has i cross points.\par
There is one number on every cross point. Denote the $j^{th}$ number on the $i^{th}$ layer as p(i,j). We can see each triad $p(i,j),p(i+1,j),p(i+1,j+1)$ form a regular triangle. An operation rotates the numbers in a single triad $p(i,j),p(i+1,j),p(i+1,j+1)$ in counterclockwise direction for 120 degrees.\par
The puzzle is, given two triangle towers of the same size with numbers on them, can the first tower become exactly the same with the second one by some operations?\par
Please note that this problem is special judged.
Input
There are no more than 20 test cases.\par
For each test case, the first line contains a integer N, indicating the number of layers of the two towers. Then N lines follow, the $i^{th}$ line contains i numbers, the $j^{th}$ number indicates p(i,j) of the first triangle tower. The following N lines describe the second triangle tower in the same format. $(1\le N\le 100,0\le p(i,j)<2^{31})$
Output
For each test case, if the solution does not exist, output a single line “-1”.\par
Otherwise, output the number of used operations M in the first line. The following M lines describe the solution, each line with two numbers i,j, separated by a single space, indicating rotating $p(i,j),p(i+1,j),p(i+1,j+1)$in counterclockwise direction for 120 degrees. You should guarantee that $1\le j\le i<N,M\le N^3$.

首先 $N$ 步以内能完成任意两个数的交换，其次一次交换不会改变逆序数的奇偶性，这可以用来判定是否有解。前N-2行暴力构造，最后两行要一起考虑，注意一下相同的数的处理就行了。
