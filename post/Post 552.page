# Bubble Cup 9 Finals [Online Mirror] H. Pokermon League challenge

n个人,e对仇恨关系.有若干个team,每个人都有一个team wish list(一个人只能加入list中的一个team).
再把这些team划分成2个阵营,满足:
each trainer belongs to exactly one team;
no team is in both conferences;
total hate between conferences is at least e / 2;
every trainer is in a team from his wish-list.
cf这题的标签是随机.以这题为例,随机题的能随机到答案的概率要怎么算呀?有没有什么固定的套路?
