#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. The One Polynomial Man

> solved by sy_chen (2:56)

##B. Alexey the Sage of The Six Paths

> unsolved

##C. Steel Ball Run

> upsolved by Roundgod

This problem can be solved by either Heavy Light Decomposition or Centroid Decomposition, who shares an idea of efficiently jumping on the heavy chain/centroid decomposition tree, and maintaining the distance information using segment tree/centroid decomposition tree. Both data structures has a complexity of $O(q(\log{n})^2)$. Refer to the code for more details. 

##D. The Jump from Height of Self-importance to Height of IQ Level

> unsolved 

##E. Minimums on the Edges

> solved by Roundgod (1:32)

Each operation can be viewed as an addition on the suffix, apply a complete-knapsack-like dynamic programming to solve the problem in $O(2^n\cdot n\cdot s)$. 

##F. IQ Test

> solved by sy_chen (0:05)

##G. AtCoder Quality Problem

> solved by Roundgod (3:44)

Observe that for some subset, if we want to color it, then there's at most one another maximal subset that has a different color, then we can solve the problem via dynamic programming in $O(2^n\cdot n)$.

##H. Mex on DAG

> solved by sy_chen (2:09 +5)

##I. Find the Vertex

> solved by sy_chen (0:11)

##J. Yet Another Mex Problem

> unsolved
