##A. The beautiful values of the palace

> solved by sy_chen (1:22)

##B. super_log

> solved by Roundgod (1:36 +6)

> solved by sy_chen (3:36)

##D. Robots

> solved by sy_chen (2:55 +5)

##E. K Sum

> solved by Roundgod (2:55 +1)

##H. Holy Grail

> solved by Roundgod (0:46)

Just run SPFA of Bellman-Ford $6$ times. 

##I. Washing clothes

> solved by Roundgod (4:32 +4)

It can be seen there exists a separation point. Enumerate on the point, and the answer is $O(\frac{n}{1}+\frac{n}{2}+\dots+\frac{n}{n})=O(n\log{n})$
