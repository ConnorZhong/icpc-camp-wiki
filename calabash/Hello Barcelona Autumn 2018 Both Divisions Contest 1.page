#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by Roundgod, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. Alice's Nim

> solved (1:41 +1)

In fact I solved the problem by guessing the solution without proof during the contest...

It's known that the losing position for the normal Nim game is that the $XOR$ of the number of all heaps equal to 0, here in this game, we state that the losing position is that the $XOR$ of the number of all piles equal to 1, since the terminal state(without any legal move) consist of an odd number of heaps of one stone each, $XOR=1$. And from the properties of the usual Nim game, any legal move from a $XOR=1$ position makes $XOR\ge 1$(since $XOR=0$ is disallowed), and from a $XOR\ge 1$ position it is always possible to move to $XOR=1$.

There's another case we need to tackle carefully, when is when $XOR=0$, where we may not transfer to a state which $XOR=1$, that is when all numbers are even, so that Alice loses in this case, either.

##B. Bags with Gifts

> solved (0:36)

Just let $dp[n]$ denote the maximum value one can get with capacity $n$ and do the simple knapsack dynamic programming. The answer for a family with $k$ children is $k\times dp[\frac{C}{k}]$.

##C. Colorful Drink

> solved (0:49 +1)

Greedily take the minimum valid density from top to bottom, this can be done using a vector and $lower\_bound$ function.

##D. Drawing Magic Triangles

> upsolved

The triangle can be viewed as the intersection of three halfplanes, then the answer is the intersection area of $3n$ halfplanes. Time complexity:$O(n\log{n})$.

##E. Enlarge Circles

> unsolved

##F. Formula

> solved (3:51 +4)

Let $next[i][j][k]$ be the minimum number we can get if we want to transform the interval $[i...i+j-1]$ into a number using a number of at most $k$ replacements, since $N\leq 10^{9}$, we only need to process at most $10$ digits. Then let $dp[i][j]$ be the minimum number we can get in the interval $[1..i]$ using at most $j$ replacements, then the transfer of states is trivial. Time complexity: $O(n^{2}\log{n}^{2})$.  

##G. GuruGuru

> solved (0:24)

Just simulate the process.

##H. Hand Patterns

> unsolved

##I. Infinite Multiplication Table

> solved (0:57)

To be added.

##J. Jiro's Job

> solved (1:17)

Calculate the shortest path of odd length and even length respectively, then do some simple case analysis to get the answer.

##K. K-rough sorting

> upsolved

For each position from left to right, we need to know what is the minimum number that can get here and then swap it to this place. So this need us to implement a data structure that supports finding the position of the minimum in a given interval and deleting an element, which can be done using a segment tree.

##L. Lucky Tickets

> unsolved

#Replay
