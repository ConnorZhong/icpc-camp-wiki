#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. Cat

> solved by sy_chen (1:12)

##B. Cats line up

> solved by Roundgod (3:49)

The state of dynamic programming should be(the last $K$ elements are adjacent/not adjacent, in the first position/last position/neither), then after generating all permutations with length $2K+1$ and finding their transitions, halving the number of states by observing the symmetry, the number of states for $K=3$ can be reduced to $C=33$, and the transition matrix has only $X=70# nonzero entries. The the problem can be solved in $O(TX)$ time.

##C. <3 numbers

> solved by Roundgod (0:14)

If $R-L+1$ is large, then the answer is always yes, otherwise one can check using brute force.

##D. Polycut

> unsolved

##E. Multiply

> solved by Roundgod (1:52 +3)

After factorizing $Y$ using Pollard-Rho, the remaining is trivial.

##F. The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything.

> solved by sy_chen (1:22 +1)

##G. Factory

> unsolved

##H. Yuuki and a problem

> solved by sy_chen (4:17)

##I. Interesting game

> solved by sy_chen (4:59)

##J. Loli, Yen-Jen, and a graph problem

> solved by Roundgod (4:55)

One can construct the case when $N$ is even by partitioning $K_{N}$ into $\frac{N}{2}$ chains with length $N$, and then split the chains for the answer. The odd case can be constructed by appending vertices to the even case.

##K. K-rectangle

> unsolved

##L. Loli, Yen-Jen, and a cool problem

> solved by sy_chen (0:46)

##M. Kill the tree

> solved by sy_chen (1:45)
