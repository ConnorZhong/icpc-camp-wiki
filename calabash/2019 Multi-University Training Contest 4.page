#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. AND Minimum Spanning Tree

> solved by Roundgod (0:23 +1)

It can be proven that if $N=2^k-1$ for some $k$, then the answer is $1$, otherwise the answer is $0$. The lexicographically smallest spanning tree can thus be easily constructed.

##B. Colored Tree

> unsolved

##C. Divide the Stones

> solved by Roundgod (2:28)

The sufficient condition is that $k$ divides $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ and $k\leq \frac{n+1}{2}$. For construction, the cases whene $n/k$ is even is trivial. For cases when $n/k$ is odd, it can solved by constructing a case for $n/k=3$ and easily reduce to the general odd case.

##D. Enveloping Convex

> unsolved

##E. Good Numbers

> unsolved

##F. Horse

> solved by Roundgod (3:59)

A crucial observation is that the contribution of the two operations to the answer is independent. Therefore we can solve each case separately. For the case of 'have a break', we may need to apply convex hull trick to make our dynamic programming runs in $O(NK)$.

##G. Just an Old Puzzle

> solved by Roundgod (1:24 +3)

One may conjecture that the moves is enough to reach all possible states. Therefore we only need to verify if a state is reachable from the starting position, which can be done by looking at the parity of the permutation.

##H. K-th Closest Distance

> solved by calabash_boy (1:26 +2)

##I. Linear Functions

> unsolved

##J. Minimal Power of Prime

> solved by Roundgod (0:53 +2)

First sieve out all primes not exceeding $N^{\frac{1}{5}}$. Then some case analysis is enough.
