#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. Polynomial in a Black Box

> solved by sy_chen (0:12)

After each query, we may compute the polynomial interpolation. If the coefficient of the highest order of term is zero, the degree of the current polynomial is the answer; otherwise, issue a new query on a different point.

##B. Board Trick

> solved by Roundgod (0:34 +2)

The strategy for Mia is to make the secret nuumber the bitwise xor of all positions with $1$ on it, which can always be done.

##C. Connectivity

> solved by sy_chen (1:56 +1)

We can always ask the vertex with the maximum conditional probability that the number of connected components decreases.

##D. Absolute Pairwise Distance

> solved by Roundgod (3:27 +1)

Use sqrt decomposition, divide the array into $O(\sqrt{n})$ blocks of size $O(\sqrt{n})$. Note that for two sorted arrays with lengths $n$ and $m$, when can find the distance between them in $O(n+m)$, we can then sort the whole array and all prefixes of each block, then precomputing the answer between each element and each block in $O(n\sqrt{n})$ time. The by calculating prefix sumes, the problem is solved in $O(n\sqrt{n})$ time and $O(n\sqrt{n})$ space.

##E. Multiplication and Division by 2

> solved by sy_chen (0:21)

Consider the binary representation of $x$ and $y$. We may trim off the leading and trailing zeros in $y$. The answer is `yes` iff $y$ is the substring of $x$.

##F. Festive Baobab

> solved by sy_chen and calabash_boy (2:36)

##G. Flatland Elections

> unsolved

##H. Eggs

> solved by Roundgod (1:17 +1)

Make the position of eggs be a consecutive segment(may be circular). When we eat an egg we eat its leftmost one, and when buying eggs we append to the end of the segment.

##I. Removing Pairs

> solved by Roundgod (0:31)

Just check if $s$ is a subsequence of $t$ with alternating parities.

##J. Boxes on a Shelf

> solved by calabash_boy (0:53 +1)

##K. Two Slicers

> solved by sy_chen (0:56 +1)

We may divide the circle into $2ab$ sectors. Then we may enumerate all possible configurations of the two slicers.
