#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. Little Q and Big Integers

> unsolved

##B. Classic Quotation

> solved by calabash_boy (2:14 +2)

##C. Counting Divisors

> solved by Roundgod (0:35 +1)

First sieve out primes no more than $10^6$, then apply a sieve-like method on the given segment, time complexity is $O(\sqrt{r}+T(r-l)\log{(r-l)})$.

##D. Dirt Ratio 

> solved by Roundgod (3:00)

Binary search on the answer, enumerate on the starting point, use segment tree to maintain prefix sums. Time complexity is $O(n\log{n}\log{\epsilon^{-1}})$

##E. Lazy Running

> solved by Roundgod (1:26 +2)

After some case analysis, the problem is reduced to find nonnegative integer coefficients $c_i$ such that $\sum\limits_{i=1}c_ix_i\geq K$ and $\sum\limits_{i=1}c_ix_i$ is minimum possible. By considering the answer modulo the smallest $x_i$, the problem is reduced to finding the shortest path to each possible modulos. 

##F. Logical Chain

> upsolved by Roundgod

Use Kosaraju's algorithm with bitset optimization. Time complexity is $O(\frac{n^2m}{w})$ where $w$ is the word size.

##G. Matching In Multiplication

> solved by sy_chen (2:36 +1)

Remove all edges incident to leaf. The resulting graph must be union of some cycles.

##H. Phone Call

> solved by calabash_boy (4:05)

##I. Questionnaire

> solved by sy_chen (0:06)

Take $ m= 2$.

##J. Security Check

> solved by sy_chen (3:02)

The difference of lengths of the two queues can not exceed $k^2$.

##K. Time to get up!

> solved by sy_chen (0:15)

Hardcode all these digits.

##L. Wavel Sequence

> solved by Roundgod (4:40 +7)

Let $f_{i,j,0/1}$ be the number of possible configurations such that the last element for the two subsequences are $a_i$ and $b_j$, respectively, and the length of the two subsequences are equal, and $g_{i,j,0/1}$ be the number of possible configurations such that the last element for the two subsequences are $a_i$ and $b_j$, respectively, and the length of the first subsequence is exactly one greater than the length of the second subsequence. The last dimension for both $f$ and $g$ denotes the relation between the last element of the first subsequence and the second last element of the first subsequence (i.e.,$<$ or $>$). To efficient update the $f$ and $g$, some data structures are needed, (e.g., fenwick tree of segment tree), and the time complexity is $O(nm\log{\max a_i})$.

##M. Yuno And Claris

> unsolved
