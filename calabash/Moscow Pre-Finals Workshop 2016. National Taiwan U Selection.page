#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. As Easy As Possible

> solved by sy_chen (0:53)

For each position $l$, define $f(l)$ as the minimum value such that range $[l, f(l))$ contains a subsequence `easy`. Then we may use binary lifting and answer each query very efficiently.

##B. Be Friends

> solved by sy_chen (3:42)

We can compute the minimum spanning tree by Boruvka's algorithm. To compute the shortest edge from each component, just use binary trie.

##C. Coprime Heaven

> unsolved

##D. Drawing Hell

> solved by sy_chen (1:28)

If the number of points strictly within the convex hull is even, the second player wins; otherwise the first player wins.

##E. Easiest Game

> upsolved by Roundgod

Assume wlog that $n\leq m$. The conclusion is that a pair $(s,t)(s\leq t)$ is valid if and only if $gcd(s+t,s-t)=1$, $s+t\leq n$ and $2t\leq m$. The remaining can be solved in $O(\sqrt{\max{(n,m})})$ per test case using Mobieus inversion and number theory sqrt decomposition.
 
##F. Fibonacci of Fibonacci

> solved by Roundgod (0:40 +2)

It can be observed that $F_{n}$ modulo $20160519$ has a period of $26880696$ without preperiod. The remaining is a simple matrix exponentiation.

##G. Global Warming

> unsolved

##H.  Hash Collision

> solved by sy_chen (3:17)

Let $F_n(x)$ be the ordinary generating function for the number of strings of length $n$ for each hash value. Note that $F_{s + t}(x) = F_s(x^{p^t})F_t(x) \mod x^m$. Note that $F_s(x^{p^t})$ can be computed by permuting the coefficients of the polynomial $F_s(x)$.

##I. Increasing or Decreasing

> solved by Roundgod (3:18)

I solved this problem using digit dynamic programming with some precalculations in $O(T\log{\max{(l,r)}})$ during the contest. A much easier method is to precompute all possible numbers, whose amount doesn't exceed $2\times 10^6$, and use binary search to find the answer.

##J.  Just Convolution

> solved by sy_chen (0:28 +1)

Update the answer by the top $n \ln n$ elements in the Minkowski sum of the two sequences. For the remaining elements in the result sequence, compute the value by brute force.
