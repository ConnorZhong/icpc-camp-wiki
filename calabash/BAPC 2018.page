#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. A Prize No One Can Win

> solved by sy_chen (0:09)

Sort the list and pick the numbers greedily.

##B. Birthday Boy

> solved by sy_chen (0:22)

Just a simple implementation task.

##C. Cardboard Container

> solved by Roundgod (0:11)

Just iterate over all possible divisors.

##D. Driver Disagreement

> upsolved by sy_chen

This can be solved by Hopcroft-Karp's DFA equivalence test algorithm.

##E. Entirely Unsorted Sequences

> solved by Roundgod (4:02)

Let $dp_i$ be the answer for the first $i$ numbers in the sorted sequence. To compute a specific $dp_i$, the answer is the number of all combinations subtract the cases where there exists some position that is sorted, enumerate on that position yields an $O(n^2)$ solution.

##F. Financial Planning

> solved by Roundgod (0:30)

Binary search for the answer, be careful with the overflow issue.

##G. Game Night

> solved by sy_chen (1:58 +1)

This can be solved by sliding window algorithm.

##H. Harry the Hamster

> upsolved by sy_chen

Reverse the edges and run a modified version of Dijkstra's shortest path.

##I. In Case of an Invasion, Please... 

> solved by calabash_boy (2:59 +3)

##J. Janitor Troubles

> solved by Roundgod (0:40)

Ternery search for the length of a diagonal and use Heron's formula to compute the answer.

##K. Kingpin Escape

> solved by Roundgod (1:01)

Clearly we need at least $\lceil \frac{l}{2} \rceil$ number of edges, where $l$ is the number of leaves. We may also construct a way where this number of edges is sufficient to make the graph biconnected: root the tree in any vertex with degree $\geq 2$, then do a depth-first traversal, say the leaves $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_l$ are sorted by their order in the depth-first traversal, we may connect $v_i$ to $v_{i+\lceil \frac{l}{2} \rceil}$ for any $1\leq i\leq \lfloor \frac{l}{2} \rfloor$. In case $l$ is odd, we may also need to connect $v_{\lceil \frac{l}{2} \rceil}$ to the root.
