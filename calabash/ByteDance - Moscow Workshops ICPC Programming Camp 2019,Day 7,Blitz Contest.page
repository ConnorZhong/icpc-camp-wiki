#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.

##A. Arithmetic on a Board

> unsolved

##B. Binary Tree

> solved by calabash_boy (1:22 +1)

##C. Codeforces

> solved by sy_chen (1:14 +2)

##D. Digit Statistics

> solved by sy_chen (1:33)

##E. Euclid

> unsolved

##F. Forbidden Triples

> solved by sy_chen (0:59 +1)

One can use inclusion-exclusion principle to derive a $O(1)$ formula.

##G. Grasshopper

> solved by sy_chen (0:30)

##H. Hand Gun

> unsolved

##I.  Intersect the Lists

> unsolved

##J. Jumping Fleas and a Dog

> solved by sy_chen (1:56)

Note that it's unnecessary to use the jump operation, so the answer is the minimum distance over all points to the destination.

##K. Key words

> solved by sy_chen (2:42 +1) 

##L. Language Troubles

> solved by sy_chen (1:27)

One can find that $f(2n+1)=2f(n)+1$, and $f(2n)=2f(n)-1$. Just calculate recursively.

##M. Multiple Barcodes

> upsolved by Roundgod

The number of non-empty rectangle is $\frac{h(h-1)w(w-1)}{4}$. For the $n=2$ case, first count all possible pairs, then minus some overcounts. Should handle a few cases.

##N. New Bus Routes

> solved by Roundgod (1:19)

Use prefix sum.

##O. Optimal Cheating

> unsolved

##P. Phi

> solved by Roundgod (0:47 +2)

Use segment sieve. Should run in $O((B-A)\log{(B-A)})$

##Q. Qualification Round

> solved by sy_chen (0:23 +1)

##R. Regular Convex Polyhedra for Dummies

> solved by sy_chen (1:51 +1)

There are only five regular polyhedra. Also use Euler's formula $E=V+F-2$ to check if the condition is satisfied.

##S. Sequence

> solved by sy_chen (0:12 +1)
