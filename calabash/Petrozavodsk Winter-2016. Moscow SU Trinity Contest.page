#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. ABBA

> solved by sy_chen (1:04 +3)

The answer is the rank of the input matrix.

##B. Black Sabbath

> unsolved

##C. Mr. Credo

> solved by sy_chen (3:14 +1)

We can safely move all lights to the origin. Find an angle not lit by any spotlight, and find a point in that half line far enough.

##D. Deep Purple

> solved by calabash_boy (4:43 +5)

##E. Elvis Presley

> solved by Roundgod (1:31)

Note that the antichain condition means no number in the set should be a prefix of another number if written in binary form. If $A$ is a prefix of $B$ in binary form or vice versa, then the answer is no. Otherwise, let's mark all prefixes of $A$ and $B$ as forbidden vertices in a 0/1 trie. To get $MinMaxAC$, one should add all vertices adjacent to the forbidden vertices to the set.

##F. Frank Sinatra

> solved by Roundgod (3:42 +2)

Apply Mo's algorithm on trees to solve the problem in $O(n\sqrt{n})$.

##G. Green Day

> solved by sy_chen (3:00 +1)

We may construct a complete graph $K_{2k}$. The edges for the first group are $(1, k+1), (1, 2), (1,3), \cdots, (1, k), (k+1, k+2), \cdots (k+1, k+k)$. All other groups are obtained by cyclic shift.

##H. Hans Zimmer

> solved by sy_chen (0:38)

A simple probability and combinatorial exercise. Use logarithms to avoid precision issue.

##I. Ivan Dorn

> upsolved by Roundgod

Process queries offline. Consider using a monotone stack to maintain the blocks of equal elements, when we pop some block of segments from the stack, they can never be extended, therefore we can record their contribution to the answer using a segment tree. Also, for elements in the stack, since they are sorted in positions, we can use another segment tree and binary search to get the answer. The overall complexity is $O(n\log{n}+m\log{n})$.

##J. Jimi Hendrix

> solved by sy_chen (1:59 +1)

For each subtree, we may record the longest prefix and suffix that could be a subsequence of a vertical path.

##K. Korn

> solved by sy_chen (4:57 +2)

The graph must be Eulerian. A vertex could be answer only if it lies in every simple cycle; or equivalently, removing the vertex yields a forest.
