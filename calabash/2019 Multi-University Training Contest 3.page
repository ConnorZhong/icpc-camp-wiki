#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. Azshara's deep sea

> unsolved

##B. Blow up the city

> solved by Roundgod (2:01)

Reverse all edges and add a root that connects to all commander points. Build the dominator tree according to this root, the answer is the number of vertices between the two query vertices minus one.

##C. Yukikaze and Demons

> unsolved

##D. Distribution of books

> unsolved

##E. Easy Math Problem

> upsolved by Roundgod

After some simple reformulations, we can find out that we need to compute $$\sum\limits_{d\text{ is prime}}d^{k+1}f(\lfloor \frac{n}{d}\rfloor)$$ where $$f(n)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}ij\cdot[gcd(i,j)==1]$$.One can find out that $$f(n)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}i^2\varphi(i)$$ after some investigations, and thus $$f(i)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}i^3-\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}i^{2}f(\lfloor \frac{n}{i}\rfloor)$$ which can thus be solved in $$O(n^{\frac{2}{3}})$$.

For the other part, we can use Min\_25 sieve to precompute $d^{k+1}$ for at the $O(\sqrt{n})$ positions in $O(\frac{n^{\frac{3}{4}}}{\log{n}})$. Therefore the final complexity is $O(n^{\frac{2}{3}}+\frac{n^{\frac{3}{4}}}{\log{n}}+k\sqrt{n})$.
