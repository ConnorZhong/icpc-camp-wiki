#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.

##A. Enju With math problem

> solved by sy_chen (1:10 +2)

##B. Fire-Fighting Hero

> solved by Roundgod (1:02)

Multiple-source shortest path problem.

##C. Hello 2019

> solved by Roundgod (2:16 +2)

Consider the dynamic programming solution for the problem, the $(\min,+)$ operation can be viewed as a kind of matrix multiplication. Use segment tree to maintain the product of matrices.

##D. Interesting Series

> solved by Roundgod (2:44)

It can be seen that $F_n=\frac{a^n}{a-1}-\frac{1}{a-1}$. For each query $k$, Let $t=[x^k]\prod\limits_{i=1}^{N}(1+a^{s_i}x)$. Then the answer is $\frac{t-\binom{N}{k}}{a-1}$. Use divide-and-conquer together with Fast Fourier Transform to calculate the coeficients in $O(n(\log{n})^2)$ time.

> solved by sy_chen (2:00 +1)
