#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by Roundgod, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. Bracket Expression

> solved (0:05 +1)

Use a stack to compute the positions of matched brackets.

##B. Checkers

> solved (1:03)

Just brute force.

##C. Convex and Compact

> unsolved

##D. Forbidden Words

> upsolved 

Encode bitmasks to run in $O(\frac{n\cdot 2^n}{w})$ time. For more details refer to [Elegant brute force](https://wcysai.github.io/2019/08/12/Elegant-Brute-force/) (in simplified Chinese)

##E. Four Prime Numbers

> solved (0:13)

First compute the number of ways to divide a number into two prime numbers, then the answer can be easily found. Time complexity is $O(\frac{n^2}{(\ln n)^2})$.

##F. Set Intersection

> solved (0:42 +3)

Use logarithms to avoid precision issues in computing factorials.

##G. Medals

> solved (4:00)

Can be modelled as maximum-flow problem.

##H. Reachability

> solved (3:09 +1)

Use std::bitset to accelerate the computing of reachability. Time complexity is $O(\frac{n^3q}{w})$.

##I. Revolving Lasers

> unsolved

##J. Snakes on the Stone

> solved (1:42)

Each time make the snake run above the already-occupied cell. One can prove that in this manner the snakes can always be untangled.

##K. Dependent Subsets

> solved (3:50 +6)

Fix a choice of a vector, then sort all other vectors, after eliminating by this vector. Then one can only take a set of dependent vectors. Take the maximum answer among all possible choices.
