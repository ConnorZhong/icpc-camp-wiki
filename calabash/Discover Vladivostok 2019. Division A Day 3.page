#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. Maximal Difference

> solved by sy_chen (0:27)

The bigger number is obtained by setting the first half of digits to $b-1$ and next digit to 1, with all other digits being 0; the smaller one is obtained by setting the first digit to 1 and the last half of digits to $b-1$, with all other digits being 0. The answer is the difference of them.

##B. Polygon Construction

> unsolved

##C. Beautiful Patterns

> solved by Roundgod (3:54 +1)

The problem can be easily reduced to finding a rank of a matrix, where each row consists of three nonzero entries. Further investigation shows that, if we construct a bipartite graph with two parts represent rows and columns, and for each known vertex in $(r,c)$ we add an edge between $r$ and $c$,then the rank is relevant to the connected components of the bipartite graph.

##D. String without repetitions

> solved by sy_chen (1:17)

It is possible to construct arbitrarily long square-free words with an alphabet of size 3.

##E. Beans gathering

> solved by Roundgod (0:21 +3)

One may see that for the gathering to be possible, the maximal $i_k$ shouldn't be larger than, i.e., $10^6$, the remaining is simple simulation.

##F. Reverse beans gathering

> solved by Roundgod (0:44)

After a few observations, one may notice that we should only leave $K\mod(i+1)$ beans in grid $i$ if we currently have $K$ beans.

##G. Equation

> solved by Roundgod (1:50 +4)

One should see that the answer can be written in the from of $ap+b$. We iterate over $b$ from $0$ to $p-1$, and can uniquely determine $a$ then.

##H. Competition

> solved by calabash_boy (1:06)

Let F(x) be the score gotten by choose the biggest x number from team B and the smallest x number from team A and let them compete.
It's not hard to observe that F(x) is a unimodal function, so triply search.

##I. The incircle

> solved by sy_chen (2:50 +19)

Binary search on the answer, then use half-plane intersection to check feasibility.

##J. The Dividing Line

> unsolved

##K. Stringangulation

> unsolved

##L. Building a cube

> unsolved
