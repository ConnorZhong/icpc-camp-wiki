#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by Roundgod, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. Alice and Maze

> solved (4:43 +9)

Just some modification of the traditional single-source shortest path problem, usd $Bellman-Ford$ or $SPFA$ algorithm to check negative loops(in this problem loops that increase total cost).

Make sure to check if $1$ and $n$ are in the same connected component.

##B. Buggy Stack Machine

> solved (3:20 +7)

Just implement the data structure, using rolling hashes to check if the condition is satisfied.

##C. Constellation

> unsolved

##D. Domination

> solved (1:39)

Since the condensation of a [tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_(graph_theory)) is a transitive tournament, so we can find the strongly connected components using $Tarjan$ or $Korasaju$, then the tournament can be ordered as $c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{k}$, the answer is then $\vert c_{1} \vert$.

##E. Elevator

> solved (0:46 +2)

Process the number from bottom to top, check for each floor if it can be merged with the upper floor, if not, the answer increases by one.

##F. Flow Strikes Back

> unsolved

##G. Good Substring

> unsolved

##H. House Selection

> solved (3:02 +1)

THe problem can be reduced to finding the number of paths with length $p+q$ in a tree, which can be solved by centroid decomposition in $O(n\log{n}^{2})$, or $O(n\log{n})$ by the property that every edge has length $1$. 

This problem can also be solved by a tree dynamic programming in $O(n(p+q))$ since $p$ and $q$ are small.

##I. Intelligence and Magic

> unsolved

##J. Jack Barmer

> unsolved

##K. Knockout Tournament

> unsolved

##L. Love Power Plant

> solved (0:50)

Greedily grabbing the letters would do.
