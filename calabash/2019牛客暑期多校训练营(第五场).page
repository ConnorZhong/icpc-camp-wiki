#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. digits 2

> solved by sy_chen (0:03)

Randomly generate a multiple of $n$ and repeat.

##B. generator 1

> solved by sy_chen (0:20)

This can be solved by matrix fast power mod.

##C. generator 2

> solved by Roundgod (3:37 +4)

Except for some edge cases, the problem can be solved by Baby Step Giant Step algorithm. If the constant is chosen properly, the algorithm should run in $O(T\sqrt{pQ})$.

##D. generator 3

> unsolved

##E. independent set 1

> solved by sy_chen (3:54 +3)

This can be solved by dynamic programming with bitmask operations.

##F. maximum clique 1

> solved by sy_chen (1:20)

The maximum clique is the maximum independent set of the complement graph, which is bipartite. In a bipartite graph, the maximum independent set is all vertices minus the minimum vertex cover, which equals the maximum bipartite matching.

##G. subsequence 1

> solved by Roundgod (1:01)

Simple dynamic programming problem.

##H. subsequence 2

> solved by Roundgod (1:46)

After checking some basic cases. Consider each appearance of each letter as vertices and add edges for the relationship described in this subsequence. There exists a valid string if and only if the graph can be topologically sorted, and their topological order is the final answer.

##I. three points 1

> solved by sy_chen (2:20 +1)

This is similar to hdu-6398.

##J. three points 2

> unsolved
