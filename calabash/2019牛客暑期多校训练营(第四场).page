#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. meeting

> solved by calabash_boy (2:08 +1)

##B. xor

> upsolved by calabash_boy 

##C. sequence

> solved by Roundgod (4:05 +2)

Fix the position of minimum value of $a$, using monotone deque to linearly compute the valid segment. The remaining is to query for maximum and minimum in some interval of prefix sum of $b$. Use segment tree to solve the problem in $O(n\log{n})$.

##D. triples I

> solved by Roundgod (3:28 +17)

Simple case analysis.

##E. triples II

> upsolved by Roundgod

After applying inclusion-exclusion principle, the remaining is just some precomputing and combinatorial arguments.

##F. merge

> unsolved

##G. tree

> unsolved

##H. RNGs

> unsolved

##I. string 

> solved by calabash_boy (1:24)

##J. free
