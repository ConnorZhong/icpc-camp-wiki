#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.

##A. Apples

> solved by sy_chen (2:55)

This problem asks whether a given number $n$ can be written as the sum of two distinct numbers of form $p^k - p^{k_1} - p^{k_2} \cdots$ where $k > k_1 > k_2 > \cdots$.

First, convert the number into base-p. Then we can dynamic program from lower digit to higher. The dp state can be written as `dp[l][c][u1][u2]` where $l$ is the number of digits considered, $c$ represents borrow from higher digit, $u1$ and $u2$ represent whether the two numbers end.

##B. Brains Eating

> unsolved

##C. Classical Problem

> solved by sy_chen (0:40 +4)

Though a cubic brute-force algorithm can easily pass this problem, this can be solved in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time. First fix a vertex, and sort all other points according to the angles to the fixed point. Then we can apply a rotational sweep line algorithm, maintaining the points in two half-planes. The total number of events (a point moves to the other half line as the sweep line rotates) is linear.

##D. Deep In The Ocean

> upsolved by sy_chen

First, direct the edges according to the Eulerian cycles. Then, we can find a perfect bipartite matching between out-direction and in-direction of each vertex. It can be proved that the perfect matching always exists for given input graph.

##E. Endgame in Reversi

> solved by sy_chen (4:28 +3)

Brute force with simple pruning can pass this problem.

##F. Frozen Orb

> unsolved

##G. Gapless Filling with Tetrominoes

> upsolved by sy_chen

This problem can be solved by state compression dynamic programming with matrix multiplication acceleration. The state is defined as the bitmask of the last 3 rows. The number of reachable states is no more than 100. To make state transition, fill the last row from right to left.

##H. Hand-made Cube

> unsolved

##I. Inverse LCP Problem

> solved by calabash_boy (2:46 +3)

reverse the origin string, then lcp(longest common prefix) becomes lcs(longest common suffix), which is LCA in SAM. And we can searching all answers according to the order.

##J. Just Created Language

> unsolved

##K. Killer
