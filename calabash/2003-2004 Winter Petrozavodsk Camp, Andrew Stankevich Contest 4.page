#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by Roundgod, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. Unique Attack

> solved (2:27 +1)

The problem asks to check if some graph has a unique minimum cut, which can be solved by comparing the minimum cut computed from a single depth-first-search from source/sink.

##B. Burning Bridges

> solved (1:29)

Apply Tarjan's algorithm for finding bridges.

##C. Circles

> upsolved

Use Euler's formula for planar graphs, then the problem is reduced to computing the number of intersecting vertices and connected components, which is way easier.

##D. Linear Programming Dual

> upsolved

A problem with pure implementation. The hardest point is to handle the input.

##E. DVD

> solved (1:08)

A classical dynamic programming problem. 

##F. Think Positive

> solved (1:42)

Concatenate the array with itself to get rid of the cyclic condition. Compute the prefix sum $sum_i$ of the new array, if a starting position $i$ is valid,  then $sum_i>\min_{k=i+1}^{i+n}sum_{k}$. Use a segment tree(or anything else) to compute the minimum overall interval.

##G. Ranking

> solved (4:11 +1)

Tough implemention needed.

##H. Driving Straight

> solved (3:15 +3)

After computing the shortest path, just follow the given instructions.
