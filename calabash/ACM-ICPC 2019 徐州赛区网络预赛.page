#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.

##A. Who is better?

> solved by sy_chen (1:57)

##B. so easy

> solved by sy_chen (0:24 +2)

##C. Buy Watermelon

> solved by sy_chen (0:10 +4)

##D. Carneginon

> solved by Roundgod (1:02)

Use Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for linear substring search.

##E. XKC's basketball team

> solved by Roundgod (1:16)

Easy Fenwick tree.

##F. Little M's attack plan

> solved by sy_chen (4:46 +13)

##G. Colorful String

> solved by sy_chen (1:07 +2)

##H. function

> solved by Roundgod (3:39 +1)

After number theoretical sqrt-decompostion, one is required to compute the number of primes, and the sum of primes in a interval, which can be computed efficiently using Min_25 sieve. Cases when numbers are powers of primes can be solved by brute force.


##I. query

> solved by sy_chen (1:29)

##J. Random Access Iterator

> solved by Roundgod (1:49 +1)

Easy tree dynamic programming.

##K. Center

> solved by sy_chen (1:41)

##L. Dice

> solved by sy_chen (2:34)

##M. Longest subsequence

> solved by Roundgod (1:34 +5)

Enumerate on the length of common prefix and solve the problem accordingly. Some preprocess is needed.
