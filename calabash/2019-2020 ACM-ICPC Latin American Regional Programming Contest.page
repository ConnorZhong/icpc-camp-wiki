#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. Algorithm Teaching

> upsolved by Roundgod

After extracting masks and add an edge from a mask to its maximal submasks, the problem is reduced to finding the smallest chain cover in a directed acyclic graph, which can be modeled as bipartite matching, and thus can be solved in $O(E\sqrt{V})$ time.

##B. Build the Perfect House

> solved by Roundgod (4:41 +5)

Binary search on the answer, to check if some answer is valid, convert each point into a range of angles and determine if all ranges have some common intersection.

##C. Cut Inequality Down

> solved by sy_chen (0:38)

##D. Dazzling Stars

> solved by sy_chen (2:10 +3)

##E. Eggfruit Cake

> solved by Roundgod (0:27 +1) 

Find all consecutive $P$s and sum up some arithmetic progressions.

##F. Fabricating Sculptures

> solved by sy_chen (1:43)

##G. Gluing Pictures

> solved by calabash_boy (1:04)

##H. Hold or Continue?

> solved by Roundgod (3:05 +1)

Iteratively update the answer, it can be conjectured that the answer converges to the need precision after a few hundred rounds.

##I. Improve SPAM

> solved by calabash_boy (0:43)

##J. Jumping Grasshopper

> upsolved by Roundgod

Let's say we jump starting from position $x$, except for the case when the grasshopper cannot jump at all, let $lmax$ be the maximum value in the range $[1,x]$, and $rmax$ be the maximum value in the range $[x,n]$. If $lmax<rmax$, then the destination would be the leftmost position in the range $[x,n]$ with value $>lmax$, and would be the rightmost position in the range $[1,x]$ with value $>rmax$ otherwise. All operations can be done in $O(\log{n})$ by a segment tree supporting range max, single point update and descending on the tree.

##K. Know your Aliens

> solved by Roundgod (1:33 +2)

For each two consecutive different letters, we multiply a monomial satisfying the sign-changing requirement, which can be proved to be optimal.

##L. Leverage MDT

> solved by sy_chen (1:34)

##M. Mountain Ranges

> solved by Roundgod (0:07)

Just find the longest consecutive parts with difference $\leq X$.
