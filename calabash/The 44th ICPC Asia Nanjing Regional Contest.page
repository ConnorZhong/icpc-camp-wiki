#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by the problem solver/upsolver, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##A. A Hard Problem

> solved by sy_chen (0:14 +2)

##B. Chessboard

> solved by sy_chen (3:32)

##C. Digital Path

> solved by sy_chen (1:32 +1)

##D. Holes

> upsolved by Roundgod

Use principal component method to reduce the number of variables to $O(n)$ and then run Gaussian Elimination for the answer.

##E. Observation

> upsolved by Roundgod

After some brute force, one can observe that $\frac{f_d}{6}$ is multiplicative, and thus can be solved using a segment sieve in $O(\sqrt{R-L}\log{(R-L)})$.

##F. Paper Grading

> upsolved by sy_chen

##G. Poker Game

> upsolved by calabash_boy

##H. Prince and Princess

> solved by Roundgod (0:43 +1)

Simple analysis. Take care of the case when $a=1,b=0,c=0$.

##I. Space Station

> upsolved by Roundgod

Note that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{50}p(i)\leq 2\cdot 10^6$, one can encode all the partitions and do dynamic programming on them.

##J. Spy

> solved by Roundgod (1:22)

Simple Kuhn-Munkres problem.

##K. Triangle

> solved by sy_chen (2:39 +5)
