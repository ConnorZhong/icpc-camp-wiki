#Editorials

Below are the editorials provided by Roundgod, refer to the solution link for more details.  

##1.  ICPC Contest Resolver

> unsolved

##2.  Horns and Hooves

> solved (0:13)

After discretize the numbers, the answer can be calculated easily.

##3. String

> solved (3:55 +2)

One can see that we only need to check $O(\log{n})$ numbers whether the string forms a period-like structure bases on these numbers. After precomputing the Z-functions, this can be solved in $O(n\log{n})$ time.

##4. Books

> solved (2:11 +2)

Typical application of Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform.

##5. Big Bed

> solved (4:20)

Enumerate on two of the dimensions, then the remaining is to check connectivity, which can be accelerated using std::bitset. Time complexity is $O(\frac{n^3}{w})$.

##6. Antichamber

> unsolved 

##7. The weasel in the hen coop

> upsolved

Can be modeled as maximum flow with lower bound on capacities.

##8. Colonization

> solved (3:57 +9)

Just implementation.

##9. Triangles

> unsolved

##10. Swimming

> unsolved

##11. Faster Than Light

> unsolved

##12. Construction of Chand Baori

> solved (0:27 +2)

The number of possible ways equals to $\prod\limits_{i=1}^{n}2i$, note that this may exceed the range of 64-bit integer.
