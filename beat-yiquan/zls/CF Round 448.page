# A. Pizza Separation
n^2^ brute force

# B. XK Segments
WA once, be careful of equality in binary search.

# C. Square Subsets
Waste some time. Gaussian elimination is the easiest solution.  
DP is also OK, should write faster.

# D. String Mark
Simple counting, just list the condition and code.  
**Do not be afraid of the coding!!**

# E. Eyes Closed
Classical segment tree problem.  
Be careful when writing `pushdown` and whole interval case in `update`, if there are multiple lazy tags.
