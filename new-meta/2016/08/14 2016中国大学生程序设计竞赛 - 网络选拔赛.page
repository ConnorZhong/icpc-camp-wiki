E. Rubik's Cube \[Yuzuriha Inori\]
==================================

The state space is small (less than 54 choosing 5). BFS suffices.

I. This world need more Zhu \[Miceren\]
=======================================

This problem will discussed in two case, big k or small k.

For big k, we can jump up from some node u and get the max.

For small k, we build a tree for each k and use union-find set to
optimize the time complexity.

All in all, the total time complextiy is $O(n \sqrt n)$
