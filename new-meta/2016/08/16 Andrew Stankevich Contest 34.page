A. Three Colors \[Miceren\]
===========================

**Description**

Given a bipartite graph, you should assign 0, 1, 2 to each edge so that
the for each pair of vertices (u, v), we have f(u) != f(v).

f(u) is the sum of incident edges' value.

**Solution**\
Consider construct methods. We want to do this problem in the residue
system modulo 3.

For each component, for each "right set" vertex, we paired them and add
1, 2, 1, 2, ... to the edges in the path alternatively between each pair
of vertices.

The only impossible case is that two vertices linked by one edge and no
other edge incident to these two vertices.

D. Border Correlation \[Miceren\]
=================================

**Description**

Given a string **s**, for each shifted version **s***, you should
determined that whether there is a string t, which is the prefix and the
suffix of **s***.

**Solution**

Because string is shifted, for a fixed shifted version, the prefix and
suffix are continuous in "double sized" original string.

By some observation, this is a mutated version of repeat string problem,
classic \O(n \log n) algorithm raised.
