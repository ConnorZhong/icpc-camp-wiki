**Problem Description**

There are $n$ stages. You are initially at stage $0$, and your target is
stage $n$. For your goal, you have to pass every stage one by one.

Saving your progress in any stage by $1$ minute and trying to go to next
stage cost $1$ minute. For every pair of stages $i$ and $i + 1$, you
have probability $p_i$ to pass and $1 - p_i$ to return to the nearest
save points.

You should choose the optimum strategy to achieve the best expectation
cost.

**Solution**

The key observation is that you may not pass $18$ stage whose $p_i < 1$
(this implies $p_i\le 0.99$ by the statement) without saving progress.
So, brute force is enough. Notice that for $p_i = 1$, you may not save
your progress before a $p_i = 1$ stages. So, the total complexity is
$O(18 n)$.
